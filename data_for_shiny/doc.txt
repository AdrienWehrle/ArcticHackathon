# # # Data Analysis

The above-presented variables are visualised through three main statistics:
	- annual means 
	- Anomaly from 1979-2000 mean
	- 1979-2021 trend 


# # # Graphical user interface

- Category: choose one of the three statistics presented in the Data Analysis section.
- Data layer: choose one of the variables presented in the Datasets section. 
- Glacier layer: activate the mask for permanent snow and ice.
- Station layer: activate the visualisation of time series at weather station locations. 
- Time evolution: move the scroll button to visualise the evolution of the selected variable and analysis. 

Options in the top-right corner will facilitate your movements across the map by resetting the axes, zooming in and out or scaling automatically. The current map can also be downloaded as a .png file.  

Hovering over the map with the mouse, the value on the pointed data cell will be displayed. By left-clicking a given point, the time series of annual means at the associated cell will be plotted and analysed through a linear regression. 
The slope, correlation value and p-value of the latter will appear by hovering over the blue line.
